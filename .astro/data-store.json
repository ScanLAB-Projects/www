This more structured welcome has averted thousands of possible shipwrecks and saved many, many lives.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"displaced-witness-006.jpg\" />\n\n#### CAMP\n\nThis ad hoc camp was established by volunteers and aid agencies outside the official Moria Registration Centre (now the Moria Detention Centre). When scanned in 2015 the camp tended to house those who were not accepted in the main registration centres. The ambition of many of the aid agencies was to extend a lighter touch than the official registration centre, with children’s entertainers, activities, warm tea and fruit.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"displaced-witness-007.jpg\" />\n\n#### LIGHTHOUSE\n\nThe Korakas peninsula forms the most northerly point of Lesvos island and marks one of the closest points to mainland Turkey. Its lighthouse signals dangerous rocks to passing ships. The light has however acted as a beacon for hundreds of nighttime voyages across the Aegean Sea, resulting in numerous tragedies as unseaworthy vessels try to land on perilous rocks. The Lighthouse Relief team, coastguards and rescue teams now try to guide arrivals away from the lighthouse and towards the safer landing beaches to the West.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"displaced-witness-005.jpg\" />\n\n#### VESTS\n\nIn the summer of 2015 the tourist beaches of Lesvos were strewn with discarded life vests and the remains of inflatable boats. In a partially ecologically, partially perceptually motivated move the local authorities began the process of systematically collecting and removing this material from the beaches. This municipal waste site on the edge of the town of Mithimna became an ever expanding landscape of life vests. The tens of thousands of vests gathered here each represents a life that has attempted to cross the ocean. The fate of their wearers is unknown, many will have been safely landed on the beaches of Scala but other vests will have washed up alone on the shores.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"displaced-witness-004.jpg\" />","src/content/projects/displaced-witness.mdx","6d1e0fbc11a0e910","displaced-witness.mdx","echoes-from-taiwan",{"id":227,"data":229,"body":236,"filePath":237,"digest":238,"legacyId":239,"deferredRender":27},{"title":230,"client":231,"subtitle":232,"description":233,"tags":234,"vimeo":235},"FRAMERATE: ECHOES FROM TAIWAN","TCCF 2023",[75],"'Echoes from Taiwan' is ScanLAB’s first international chapter of FRAMERATE featuring a series of Taiwanese landscapes.",[19,21],"859037337","import Block from \"$lib/components/Block.astro\";\nimport ImageMagic from \"$lib/components/ImageMagic.astro\";\n\n### 'Echoes from Taiwan' is ScanLAB’s first international chapter of FRAMERATE featuring a series of Taiwanese landscapes. ‘Echoes’ focuses on bustling, industrious activity in Taipei, Kaohsiung and in and amongst the breathtaking and spiritual landscapes across the island.

Experience of the virtual is complemented by the performer’s delicate touch and digital presence within the work.\n\nDesigned to appeal to visitors from outside the headset as well as within, the stage-set takes the form of a beautiful, fragmented exhibition, giving a skeletal impression of the hidden virtual space inside.\n\nEternal Return is a collaboration with Swedish artist duo Lundahl & Seitl.\n\n\u003CBlock type=\"info\" title=\"Tour Info:\" body={[\n\"Eternal Return premiered at STRP Festival, Eindhoven, April 2019.\",\n\"WELD, Stockholm, May 2019\",\n\"Göteborgs Konsthall, Gothenburg, August 2019\",\n\"SXSW Virtual Cinema, Austin, March 2020\",\n\"CPH:DOX, Copenhaghen, March 2020\",\n\n]} />\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"eternal-return-01.jpg\" />\n\nThe work is formed of three chapters Stromatolites, The Memor and The Fugue.\n\n#### Stromatolites /\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"eternal-return-02.jpg\" />\nSome of the first forms of life on Earth are recorded in rocks. In the installation,\nbelow the 3d-printed objects, is some of the oldest photosynthesizing life on earth:\n3.5 billion years old Stromatolites (Greek for “layered rock”). Consisting of layers\nof single-celled cyanobacteria, forming microbial reefs, the stromatolite was a probability\nengine: an actualizer of life.\n\nBefore the stromatolites, air contained only one percent oxygen. Within the stromatolite there is a string of data: the first form of memory, the single-cell bacteria. This lifeform enables more advanced cells to form. A collaborative symbiotic community of cells, packed together and exposed to friction, were the first step towards consciousness.\n\nThis part of the installation is an encounter with a digital entity modelled after the Stromatolites. Tuning in with the visitors movement, without a word, this cluster of points asks the question: what is the actualizer of life in the digital realm?\n\n#### The Memor /\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"eternal-return-04.jpg\" />\nThe central part of Eternal Return is The Memor: a digital archive of buildings,\nlandscapes, sounds, smells and even traces of people.\n\nThe state of a memory in The Memor is much like the human mind: a stable structure of a neural network as it is NOW, but every return to that memory changes it. Mirrored in The Memor are the ways in which traces of the earth’s past are recorded in rocks and fossils, as arrangements of minerals in stable structures that we examine in the present.\n\nWithout a witness to record each event, stars collide, neutrons merge, nebulae form. Likewise without a visitor, The Memor remains an archive of forms, sounds and scents in no particular order.\n\n#### The Fugue /\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"eternal-return-06.jpg\" />\nInside The Fugue, pianist Cassie Yukawa-McBurney performs J. S. Bach’s Fugue in A\nMinor BWV 543 written for the organ, arranged by Liszt for piano.\n\nFugue or Fugue State is the psychological term for when the brain does not find where memory is. For the pianist, the fugue played is like a process of remembering. For her audience, the electromagnetic waves of sound carry information to our senses. Remember - only the disturbance is travelling, not the air. The unbodied human consciousness became the disturbance travelling from the old world to the new.\n\nEternal Return is accompanied by a science fiction novel, The Memor by Malin Zimm, which offers an expanded narrative of the exhibition.\n\nE-book download link: [Eternal Return The Memor](href=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/154-ls-eternalreturn/PROMO/Eternal_Return_The_Memor_TheBook.pdf\")\n\nEternal Return is a STRP co-production and collaboration with the artist duo Lundahl & Seitl\n\nEternal Return has been supported by:\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"invert\">\n  \u003CImageMagic href=\"eternal-return-sponsorship-logos.jpg\" />\n\u003C/div>","src/content/projects/eternal-return.mdx","15b72f39bff74e7e","eternal-return.mdx","frozen-relic",{"id":253,"data":255,"body":262,"filePath":263,"digest":264,"legacyId":265,"deferredRender":27},{"title":256,"client":257,"subtitle":258,"description":259,"tags":260,"vimeo":261},"Frozen Relic: Arctic Works","AA Gallery Exhibition",[75],"Frozen Relic: Arctic Works, recreates the Arctic landscape in its natural material – frozen saltwater.",[21,19,64,77],"65902863","import InlineImages from \"$lib/components/InlineImages.astro\";\nimport ImageMagic from \"$lib/components/ImageMagic.astro\";\n\nExhibition - The Architectural Association London.\n\nFollowing the Climate Impact Tour expeditions to the Fram Strait we were commissioned to produce an exhibition at the Architectural Association Gallery, London. The exhibition, Frozen Relic: Arctic Works, recreated the sea ice landscape in its natural material – frozen saltwater. Each piece is a digitally fabricated scale replica of an original ice floe which was 3D scanned from above and documented using underwater sonar from below. The completed digital survey models are used to guide a CNC machine which carved the moulds in which each replica was frozen.\n\nVisitors entering the gallery found themselves in a darkened room, the suspended ice floes glowing in an icy archipelago. Like the fragile environment they are born from, these exhibits disappeared. The sound of dripping filled the air. Over the course of the show the exhibits melted into perfectly sized drip trays below, being refrozen and rehung for the following day. As the installation melted, it left only the supporting structure which itself accurately represents the scientific data that remains of this captured ice floe. Left with only the forensic records, the show speculated a disappearing Polar landscape for which architects may only ever design for posthumously.\n\nDownload the exhibition poster [here](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/scanlab-out/public/AA_Exhibition_Guide_ScanLAB_Projects.pdf).\n\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"aa-frozen-relic-001.jpg\"\n  caption=\"A view of the melting ice in the gallery space\"\n/>\n\u003CInlineImages>\n  \u003CImageMagic\n    href=\"aa-frozen-relic-002.jpg\"\n    caption=\"The constantly melting exhibits were replaced every two to three days\"\n  />\n  \u003CImageMagic\n    href=\"aa-frozen-relic-003.jpg\"\n    caption=\"The remains of an ice floe after three days of melting\"\n  />\n\u003C/InlineImages>\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"aa-frozen-relic-004.jpg\"\n  caption=\"3D Scan of Arctic Ice Floe: Floe A1006 in September 2011, Fram Strait, North West of Svalbard\"\n/>\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"aa-frozen-relic-007.jpg\"\n  caption=\"Perspectival Polar biased conical projection map of the Fram Strait and scanned floes\"\n/>","src/content/projects/frozen-relic.mdx","d9d8f8e1e5812685","frozen-relic.mdx","forensic-architecture",{"id":266,"data":268,"body":274,"filePath":275,"digest":276,"legacyId":277,"deferredRender":27},{"title":269,"client":270,"subtitle":271,"description":272,"tags":273,"background":172},"Living Death Camps","Forensic Architecture",[75],"The Living Death Camps project forms part of the European Research Council-funded project hosted by the Centre for Research Architecture, Goldsmiths University of London and forms part of the exhibition FORENSIS at Haus der Kulteren der Welt, Berlin in March 2014.",[77],"import InlineImages from \"$lib/components/InlineImages.astro\";\nimport ImageMagic from \"$lib/components/ImageMagic.astro\";\n\nThe Living Death Camps Project by Forensic Architecture combines terrestrial laser scanning with ground penetrating radar to dissect the layers of life and evidence at two concentration camp sites in former Yugoslavia.

The work follows a series of taphonomic experiments, charting the decay of pig carcasses in a field in rural England.\n\n\u003CQuote>\n  Anatomists call the pig “horizontal human” because of what we share inside1\n\u003C/Quote>\nHumans and pigs are anatomically and physiologically incredibly similar. They share\na similar muscle to fat ratio, similar organ position, a similar skeletal arrangement.\nOur skin is similar to their skin2, so much so that tattoo artists train on pork\njoints from the butchers. Talk of pig to human transplants and blood transfusions\nhas created tabloid headlines and been considered by commercial biotech companies\nsuch as PPL Therapeutics, famous for cloning Dolly the Sheep3 4.\n\nOur similarities do not rest at the physical; our affinity extends to the personality and cognitive abilities of pigs. They are said to exhibit complex emotions, and infamously fill the 'human' role in Orwell's Animal Farm5 6. Historically they themselves (not their owners) have even been held accountable for crimes and punished in accordance to our own laws7. Their flesh is the most readily eaten by mankind, constituting over a third of all meat consumption8. It is also said their flesh tastes most similar to human flesh, owing to the human cannibals of New Guinea calling their victims 'long pigs'9.\n\nIt is the similarity of their flesh and ours that make pigs perfect human substitutes for the study of decomposition. At TRACES (University of Central Lancashire) pig carcasses are monitored from the moment of death to eventual decomposition. This process helps us understand our own bodily decay and crucially assists in pinpointing the exact moment of death when a partially decayed human body is encountered in crime scene investigations.\n\nAn array of bizarre, staged scenarios unfold across a piece of Lancashire landscape, where close to one hundred pig carcasses are monitored annually. The pigs' bodies are framed on concrete plinths, hung from scaffold frames, half buried. They are hidden in plastic wheelie bins, in suitcases, under tarpaulins. They are shot, burned, tattooed. They lie with plastic bags on their heads, or with the tell-tale scars of a forensic autopsy along their torso. Each act is carried out with clinical precision, under strict guidelines and with acute scientific rigour. Every act is a replication or a simulation of a possible human demise.\n\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"HorizontalHumans_01.jpg\"\n  caption=\"fetal_pig02 Image courtesy from Biology Corner CC-BY-NC-3.0\"\n/>\n\nG.

Here we navigate a cloud of over a billion precisely\nmeasured points that form spatial snapshots of the decomposition process. This data\nis forming a new type of spatial evidence for the research teams, a perfect 3D snapshot\nthat can be investigated remotely and in perpetuity. These digital doppelgängers\nare frozen in time at the moment they are collected. The data is not subject to weather,\nto interruption, to disturbance. As such they can form a critical tool in capturing\nthat which is later deemed to be important, but on first inspection was not.\n\nIn Horizontal Humans the evidence drifts from impartiality to narrative, from 'fact' to framed or staged view. The pointcloud is sometimes indisputable while at other times it drifts into abstraction, allowing the edges of the images to fade into illusion. The essence of the scene remains, the details remain, but the investigation is left to evolve in the eye of the viewer and not given solely to the expert witness.\n\nSociety and the law continue to consider the position of the photograph as an empirical register of evidence. We are all too familiar with the medium's ease of manipulation and the computer's ability to mimic photo realism either in still image or in film. Our relationship with these two dimensional images of the world is now much more complex, and their technical processing shapes our digital world view.\n\nLaser scanning is a relatively new form of capture and is enjoying a heyday of perceived reliability, impartiality and freedom from bias. It is a tool of 'measure' in the first instance and not a tool of 'sight'. LIDAR's users are, for the large part, precision driven engineers and surveyors - they pursue the truth, they are trained to be impartial witnesses to the morphology of space.\n\nHorizontal Humans both endorses and questions this reliability. The project suggests that the act of framing, staging and designing are alive and present in the art of scanning, or at least they can be. This is the anomaly of 3D scanning as an image making process - the act of data 'capture' and the act of image 'framing' can be dramatically removed from one another. On the one hand the data collection can be impartial but the framing and revisiting of that data can be highly emotive. On the other hand the moment of capture itself can bias a dataset and thus heavily author the spatial 'reality.'\n\n\u003CInlineImages>\n  \u003CImageMagic href=\"HorizontalHumans_03.jpg\" caption=\"Timelapse 3D scanning\" />\n  \u003CImageMagic href=\"HorizontalHumans_02.jpg\" />\n\u003C/InlineImages>\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"HorizontalHumans_05.jpg\" caption=\"The Hanging - detail\" />\n\n**Ethics + Animal Welfare**\n\n\u003Csmall>\n  Horizontal humans depicts a series of experiments conducted in 2015 at TRACES,\n  The University of Central Lancashire's Taphonomic Research in Anthropology:\n  Centre for Experimental Studies.

ScanLAB Projects joins presenters Alexander Armstrong and Dr Michael Scott as they explore the hidden spaces that have helped these great cities change the world. The programmes bring a fascinating, fresh perspective to 2,000 years of history, from the original Roman bath complex outside Naples, through the reign of the Venetian Doge’s to the birth of the Renaissance in Florence.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"BBCitaly.jpg\" />\n\nNew technology places a crucial role across the shows. In the Bay of Naples we scan frescos underwater using sub-sea LIDAR techniques. In Venice the entire length of the Grand Canal is mapped in the only way possible - from a moving boat. And in Florence the entire Vasari corridor is mapped in under an hour using mobile, backpack scanning.\n\nEach show ends with an immersive experience as the presenters don VR headsets and revisit key locations from the show virtually. This final dissection process gives the freedom to explore entire locations at 1:1 scale and as miniature dollshouse replicas, offering new and often impossible perspectives. The programmes are each accompanied by interactive 360 content online for audiences to explore. These unique experiences allow the audience to navigate the same datasets captured on location by the scanning team and used to make the original show graphics.\n\n#### Naples\n\nIn Naples we explore the Bourbon Tunnels, a true time travelling experience through original Roman cisterns that latter became 17th century aqueducts, 19th century escape tunnels and finally second world war air raid shelters. The team map in unprecedented detail the tragic ruins of Herculaneum, Roman quarries and Neapolitan catacombs, before ended in Baiae at the original Roman pleasure baths, much of which is submerged under the Bay of Naples.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"ItalysInvisibleCities_Naples_Herculaneum_01.jpg\" />\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"ItalysInvisibleCities_Naples_NewQuarry_01.jpg\" />\n\n#### Venice\n\nVenice sees ScanLAB take to the water, scanning the entire length of the Grand Canal and the naval might of the Arsenale. We also reveal the original ghetto, the Jewish quarters and the stunning, secret synagogues nestled inside unassuming facades. The show’s finale explores the Doge’s Palace, revealing the intricate and interlaced public and private spaces that allows this single building to act as the city’s equivalent of 10 Downing Street, The House of Parliament, Buckingham Palace and the torture chambers of the Tower of London.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"ItalysInvisibleCities_Venice_Canal_02.jpg\" />\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"ItalysInvisibleCities_Venice_Ghetto_01.jpg\" />\n\n#### Florence\n\nIn the series finale the scans reveal Florence as the birthplace of the Renaissance. Here it is less the infrastructure of quarries and aqueducts that are unearthed but instead the intense, lavish interiors of palazzo’s, corridors of power and collections of art. We explore the length of the Vasari corridor weaving through the city, across Ponte Vecchio and its contents, one of the world’s most extensive art collections - the Uffizi Gallery. We capture the interiors of Palazzo Vecchio, Palazzo Medici and Michelangelo's secret chamber, hidden beneath the Church of San Lorenzo.

Utilising the latest in CT, laser and photogrammetric 3D scanning techniques we’ve finally been able to peer inside the casts of Pompeii, reveal the position of slaves quarters hidden underground and examine in unprecedented detail the recently restored frescoes.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"BBCPOMPEII_01.jpg\" />\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"BBCPOMPEII_06.jpg\"\n  caption=\"Overturning previous stories and assumptions the CT provides new insights into the lives of those who lived at Pompeii\"\n/>\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"BBCPOMPEII_05.jpg\"\n  caption=\"A 3D scan of the casts in the exhibition\"\n/>\nMary unpicks the human stories behind the tragic figures: gladiators, slaves, businesswomen\nand children whose remains are famously preserved at Pompeii. With help from expert\nEstelle Lazer and her team from University of Sydney the CT data and x-rays have\nallowed forensic archaeologists to challenge previous assumptions about their lives\nand discover the real identities behind the people unable to escape the eruption.\n\nCaptured in forensic detail, the scans of Pompeii represent one of the most comprehensive digitisations of Pompeii to date. Covering the whole archaeological site the scans allow it to be explored like never before.\n\nThe CT data, terrestrial laser scanning and aerial photogrammetry was captured on location in Pompeii over 10 days in September 2015.

Our expedition, in Summer 2016, was not equipped with cameras but instead with the latest terrestrial laser 3D scanning equipment. The completed work - a high fidelity 3D hologram of Yosemite Valley - was on display at LACMA in Spring 2017.\n\nIn the 1870’s Eadweard Muybridge looked to Yosemite as a setting to test his pioneering photographic techniques. These early expeditions have been replicated throughout history, most famously by Ansel Adams, but more recently by thousands of digitally enabled adventurers with comparatively tiny cameras tucked into their pockets.\n\nPost-lenticular Landscapes re-enacted these expeditions equipped with the very latest in terrestrial laser scanning technology. This crusade has unearthed the three dimensional facts of the landscape allowing the photographic experience of Muybridge, Adams and a thousand other visitors to be digitally replicated and realising Muybridge’s original endeavour to capture the scenes in three dimensions as stereograms.\n\n#### Expedition - May / June 2016\n\nIn Yosemite we established a digital base camp, the centre point of which was a matte grey 4x4 vehicle which acted as our hub for processing collected 3D scan data. Over 15 days we ventured up into the National Park and to a series of key locations including Vernal and Nevada Falls. In the age of the iphone camera and the selfie our expedition was comparatively heavily laden (our laser scanning equipment took eight people to transport during the expedition!). The logistics of taking such high tech equipment into a comparatively inaccessible environment formed a major part of the re-enactment, mirroring the epic nature of the early pioneer photographers.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"post-lenticular-landscapes-A07.jpg\" />\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"post-lenticular-landscapes-A06.jpg\" />\n#### Urban Diorama - LACMA - Spring 2017 Set within the stripped out interior of\nour expedition vehicle floats a high fidelity hologram of Yosemite Valley.\nMillions of precisely measure points hover together in space to form a ghostly\napparition of mountains, forest, cliff face and tumultuous waterfalls.
