Accompanying sea ice scientists from The Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) at the University of Cambridge aboard the Greenpeace icebreaker ship the Arctic Sunrise, the team captured the detailed surface geometry of a total of 26 ice floes. Each was mapped using terrestrial LIDAR and the undersides captured using underwater sonar from below. Together this top and bottom surface information provide one of the most detailed snapshots of sea ice morphology to date.\n\nThese detailed samples of ice floe form feed into wider scale theoretical and mathematical modelling undertaken at Cambridge. This precise data allows validation and calibration of large scale data captured from aerial photography, satellite measurement, tracking of ice flow and Arctic ocean currents. Ultimately, the data feeds into models aiming to understand and predict the trends in global sea ice levels with respect to climate change and global warming.\n\nThe scan data collected not only feeds digital simulations and computational models of the arctic region; it has also given the scientists and campaigners compelling new tools for describing and visualising the work that they do in the arctic regions.\n\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"arctic-001.jpg\"\n  caption=\"The Arctic Sunrise wedged between ice floes in the Fram Strait. © Nick Cobbing/Greenpeace\"\n/>\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"arctic-002.jpg\"\n  caption=\"Diagram showing position of drill holes and scan locations\"\n/>\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"arctic-003.jpg\"\n  caption=\"Drill holes measure the thickness of ice. © Nick Cobbing/Greenpeace\"\n/>","src/content/projects/climate-impact-tour.mdx","862cf5804e46dd5e","climate-impact-tour.mdx","bartlett-transformation",{"id":45,"data":47,"body":56,"filePath":57,"digest":58,"legacyId":59,"deferredRender":29},{"title":48,"client":49,"subtitle":50,"description":51,"tags":52,"background":55},"Bartlett Transformation 2013-2018","UCL",[36],"The Bartlett School of Architecture underwent £30 million renovation between 2013 and 2017, transforming their former home Wates House into an award winning new building 22 Gordon Street.

The £30 million refurbishment and extension was carried out by architects Hawkins\\Brown as part of UCL’s Bloomsbury Campus Refurbishments project.\n\nThe first scans of Wates House were taken in the final weeks before the building was vacated in 2014, and a further 900 scans were added during the 2017 Bartlett Summer Show in its newly re-fabricated home. The resulting data set was assembled and overlaid to create two digital pointcloud models. The dual phases of the film vividly reveal the substantial change in space and scale brought about by the refurbishment.\n\nCapturing these spaces before and after renovations and subsequent occupation by the Faculties with over 2500 scans, detailing every studio nook and corridor crany, the transformation animation overlays the past and the present day school.\n\nThroughout the animation the ambition is to present a sense of The Bartlett as a unique, densely packed, building scale machine for experimentation, creativity and learning.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"22GordonStreet_Section_03.jpg\" />\n\u003CInlineVimeo id=\"231044052\" />\n#### HAMPSTEAD ROAD\n\nDuring the renovation of Gordon Street, The Bartlett occupied a temporary home on Hampstead Road. The former warehouse buildings were an empty shell across 3 floors before the 2014 Hawkins Brown designed renovation took place. The renovated space contained digital fabrication suites, workshops, studios, offices, IT Labs, a cafe, lecture theatres and exhibition space.\n\nThe structure is scanned before and after renovation, complete with occupation. Key to the visualisation here is a technique of time swiping across the 3D data set as the camera moves.

Displaced Witness offers four scenes - the arrival beaches of Skala Sikamineas, an ad-hoc camp outside the official Moria Registration Centre, the Lighthouse on the Korakas peninsula, and the vast piles of life vests at the edge of the town of Mithimna.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"displaced-witness-001.jpg\" />\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"displaced-witness-002.jpg\" />\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"displaced-witness-003.jpg\" />\n\n#### ARRIVALS\n\nThe beaches of Skala Sikamineas are the point of arrival for many boats from Turkey. Boats are often guided in by volunteer lifeguards having been directed toward several unofficial volunteer camps who provide assistance, warm clothes, food and a friendly welcome to those who make the journey. Prior to the establishment of these camps and the process of guiding arriving vessels in, boats would land at perilous locations with those on board having to walk miles across rugged terrain to find civilisation. This more structured welcome has averted thousands of possible shipwrecks and saved many, many lives.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"displaced-witness-006.jpg\" />\n\n#### CAMP\n\nThis ad hoc camp was established by volunteers and aid agencies outside the official Moria Registration Centre (now the Moria Detention Centre). When scanned in 2015 the camp tended to house those who were not accepted in the main registration centres. The ambition of many of the aid agencies was to extend a lighter touch than the official registration centre, with children’s entertainers, activities, warm tea and fruit.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"displaced-witness-007.jpg\" />\n\n#### LIGHTHOUSE\n\nThe Korakas peninsula forms the most northerly point of Lesvos island and marks one of the closest points to mainland Turkey. Its lighthouse signals dangerous rocks to passing ships. The light has however acted as a beacon for hundreds of nighttime voyages across the Aegean Sea, resulting in numerous tragedies as unseaworthy vessels try to land on perilous rocks. The Lighthouse Relief team, coastguards and rescue teams now try to guide arrivals away from the lighthouse and towards the safer landing beaches to the West.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"displaced-witness-005.jpg\" />\n\n#### VESTS\n\nIn the summer of 2015 the tourist beaches of Lesvos were strewn with discarded life vests and the remains of inflatable boats. In a partially ecologically, partially perceptually motivated move the local authorities began the process of systematically collecting and removing this material from the beaches. This municipal waste site on the edge of the town of Mithimna became an ever expanding landscape of life vests. The tens of thousands of vests gathered here each represents a life that has attempted to cross the ocean. The fate of their wearers is unknown, many will have been safely landed on the beaches of Scala but other vests will have washed up alone on the shores.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"displaced-witness-004.jpg\" />","src/content/projects/displaced-witness.mdx","1748f957deb47418","displaced-witness.mdx","desert-pulse",{"id":102,"data":104,"body":113,"filePath":114,"digest":115,"legacyId":116,"deferredRender":29},{"title":105,"client":106,"subtitle":107,"description":108,"banner":109,"tags":110,"background":111,"mobile":112},"DESERT PULSE","Desert Botanical Garden, Phoenix, Arizona",[],"DESERT PULSE is an ambitious artwork commissioned by Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona.","DBG--banner.jpg",[22],"Body_DBG9.jpg","DBG--hero_DBG.jpg","import ImageMagic from \"$lib/components/ImageMagic.astro\";\n\n\u003Ch3>\n  DESERT PULSE is an ambitious artwork commissioned by Desert Botanical Garden\n  in Phoenix, Arizona.

Commanded by the Greeks, Romans, Venetians and Ottomans, the city’s location on the peninsula and its defensive walls came to play an important role in the city’s history. An ambitious attempt to map the whole city and its walls is undertaken by the team using a helicopter and photogrammetric scanning technology, concluding in one of the most stunning and detailed city wide scans ever completed. The team also descended on the Hagia Sophia, one of the world oldest churches - now a mosque - to scan and inspect its wobbly looking dome.\n\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"ancient-05.jpg\"\n  caption=\"Aerial scan of the Istanbul Peninsula\"\n/>\n\n\u003CHeading>ATHENS\u003C/Heading>\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"ancient-06.jpg\"\n  caption=\"Aerial and ground LIDAR scan of the Erechtheion Temple in the Athens Acropolis\"\n/>\n\nOne of the oldest cities in the world, here we look at the birthplace of democracy.

The work was presented as a ticketed dance performance and an ongoing gallery show at the Southbank Centre in 2016. Its origins lie in the earliest artistic experiments at the studio, when Shaw and Trossell were primarily making sculpture: they sat deep in curiosity about movement, 3D motion blur, and the ability of a scanner to record in four dimensions - and the possibility to use these tools to turn ephemeral moments into physical sculptures with weight and volume.

Are we survivors or fossils in the journey of tomorrow?\n\nDrawing on experiential theatre practice, the audience became directly involved in the intimate performance, invited to explore radical technology, movement and live music inside the lesser-known spaces of the Royal Festival Hall.\n\n#### GALLERY SHOW: COLLAPSE - An Exhibition of Remains\n\nA series of sculptures, film and sound act as spatial memories of the COLLAPSE performance. Digitally fabricated fragments of dancers' limbs are suspended, lingering where their performer once created them. Traces of movement are solidified and stand as physical echoes, unearthed, archaeological monuments sitting within a landscape of projections and sound.\n\nThe sculptures talk of a recent event now passed, but also hint at the perpetual human cycle of boom, exuberance, downfall and rediscovery. The film and audio backdrop depict the natural and manmade terrain that informs these cycles and is itself dramatically influenced by the human motions now frozen within. The city rises and falls in the background as the digital dust that both sustains and threatens our time.\n\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"collapse-02.jpg\"\n  caption=\"New Movement Collective perform COLLAPSE at the Southbank Centre, Aug 2016\"\n/>\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"collapse-03.jpg\"\n  caption=\"New Movement Collective perform COLLAPSE at the Southbank Centre, Aug 2016\"\n/>\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"collapse-04.jpg\" caption=\"3D scan of dancers in motion\" />\n\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"collapse-05.jpg\"\n  caption=\"COLLAPSE: An Exhibition of Remains, Southbank Centre, Aug 2016\"\n/>\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"collapse-06.jpg\" />\n\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"collapse-07.jpg\"\n  caption=\"COLLAPSE in performance at the Barbican Centre, 2014\"\n/>","src/content/projects/collapse.mdx","b22a736c912ec5df","collapse.mdx","felixs-room",{"id":161,"data":163,"body":172,"filePath":173,"digest":174,"legacyId":175,"deferredRender":29},{"heading":164,"title":166,"client":167,"description":168,"tags":169,"background":171,"mobile":161},[165],"World Premiere: Berliner Ensemble, Berlin (DE), 2023","FELIX'S ROOM","Berliner Ensemble, June 2023","Felix's Room is a digital hybrid theatre production which reconstructs the life of Felix and Erna Ganz after their imprisonment in a so-called 'Judenhaus' in 1942.",[23,170,22],"live","FelixsRoom_Body1--hero.jpg","import Quote from \"$lib/components/Quote.astro\";\nimport Block from \"$lib/components/Block.astro\";\nimport ImageMagic from \"$lib/components/ImageMagic.astro\";\n\n### Felix's Room is a digital hybrid theatre production which reconstructs the life of Felix and Erna Ganz after their imprisonment in a so-called 'Judenhaus' in 1942.

Consisting of layers\nof single-celled cyanobacteria, forming microbial reefs, the stromatolite was a probability\nengine: an actualizer of life.\n\nBefore the stromatolites, air contained only one percent oxygen. Within the stromatolite there is a string of data: the first form of memory, the single-cell bacteria. This lifeform enables more advanced cells to form. A collaborative symbiotic community of cells, packed together and exposed to friction, were the first step towards consciousness.\n\nThis part of the installation is an encounter with a digital entity modelled after the Stromatolites.

Mirrored in The Memor are the ways in which traces of the earth’s past are recorded in rocks and fossils, as arrangements of minerals in stable structures that we examine in the present.\n\nWithout a witness to record each event, stars collide, neutrons merge, nebulae form.

The voices in the soundtrack are those of real refugees who guide the viewer through the experience - from arriving in an unfamiliar city to acute worry for loved ones left behind, concern about not being allowed to work, and the Home Office interview on which so much rides.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"guardian-limbo-002.jpg\" />\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"guardian-limbo-003.jpg\" />\nWhat is it like to flee your home and start again in a new country?\n\nAsylum seekers live on £5 a day while they wait to hear whether they can stay in the UK. This virtual reality film for The Guardian allows you to experience how this period of limbo feels, waiting for a decision that will affect the rest of your life.\n\nBetween April 2016 and March 2017, 36,846 people applied for asylum in the UK. As of March, a backlog in cases meant the total number of people still waiting for a decision stood at nearly 31,500. While asylum seekers wait for their Home Office interview and the subsequent decision, they live on £5 a day and are unable to work or choose where they live. In Limbo you step into their shoes and experience their state of mind while you wait for the decision that will determine the rest of your life.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"guardian-limbo-004.jpg\" />\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"guardian-limbo-001.jpg\" />\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"guardian-limbo-006.jpg\" />\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"guardian-limbo-008.jpg\" />\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"guardian-limbo-009.jpg\" />\n\nIn 2021, Limbo was chosen to be part of the ‘Immersive Arcade: The Showcase’ on the Museum of Other Realities platform, featuring the best British XR works since 2000.

Horizontal Humans sees the studio follow a series of taphonomic experiments, charting the decay of pig carcasses in a field in rural England. The artwork asks the question of artistic provenance for the 3D dataset of over a billion points - showing a tool used primarily for ‘objective’ scientific measurement as a highly subjective imaging device, and the future of photography. It is an early testament that the act of framing, staging and designing are alive and present in the art of scanning.\n\n\u003Cstrong>\n  Anatomists call the pig “horizontal human” because of what we share inside\n  \u003Csup>1\u003C/sup>\n\u003C/strong>\n\nHumans and pigs are anatomically and physiologically incredibly similar.

At TRACES (University of Central Lancashire) pig carcasses are monitored from the moment of death to eventual decomposition. This process helps us understand our own bodily decay and crucially assists in pinpointing the exact moment of death when a partially decayed human body is encountered in crime scene investigations.\n\nAn array of bizarre, staged scenarios unfold across a piece of Lancashire landscape, where close to one hundred pig carcasses are monitored annually. The pigs' bodies are framed on concrete plinths, hung from scaffold frames, half buried. They are hidden in plastic wheelie bins, in suitcases, under tarpaulins. They are shot, burned, tattooed. They lie with plastic bags on their heads, or with the tell-tale scars of a forensic autopsy along their torso. Each act is carried out with clinical precision, under strict guidelines and with acute scientific rigour. Every act is a replication or a simulation of a possible human demise.\n\n\u003Csmall>\n1.G.

Like the fragile environment they are born from, these exhibits disappeared - more quickly when there were more people; accelerating as they lost thermal mass. The sound of dripping filled the air, a natural sound track. Over the course of the show the exhibits melted into perfectly sized drip trays below, being refrozen and rehung for the following day. As the ice melted, it left only the supporting structure which itself accurately represents the scientific data that measured that ice floe - months before.

Three-dimensional stories unfold across this multichannel installation. Hypnotic imagery surrounds you. Audio shifts through the space. Spring breaks, summer sun shines through the leaves as they turn amber and fall a second later. In a quaint English garden a pumpkin grows. A thousand tonnes of steel are crushed. Sand ebbs and flows while a cliff retreats. 268 cows are milked. 519 pints are drunk.\n\nCreated from thousands of daily 3D time-lapse scans of British landscapes, the work observes change on a scale impossible to see with the lens of traditional cameras.\n\nThis is not just an artwork. The data collected and presented by FRAMERATE is ground-breaking scientific research, containing empirical, measurable facts published that have since been published in NATURE.\n\nWe glimpse a future perpetually documented by the eyes of a billion autonomous vehicles and personal devices, creating high fidelity spatial records of the earth.\n\nFRAMERATE: Pulse of the Earth invites you to observe in another way. To think and feel in another time scale: geological time, seasonal time, tidal time. To contemplate change, and the pace of change. This is a space where your perspective might shift.\n\nWith the generous support of Taiwanese partner, TAICCA, we produced our first international chapter, ‘Echoes from Taiwan’. The work premiered at TCCF in Taipei where it was exhibited at the Songshan Cultural & Creative Park in November 2023. [More info on that work](/projects/echoes-from-taiwan).\n\nAs architects and spatial thinkers where we situate the work has a profound impact on the installations we create.

The completed work - high fidelity 3D holograms of Yosemite Valley - exhibit across dioramas, large LED screens, and Digital Lambda C-type prints.\n\nIn the 1870’s Eadweard Muybridge looked to Yosemite as a setting to test his pioneering photographic techniques. These early expeditions have been replicated throughout history, most famously by Ansel Adams, but more recently by thousands of digitally enabled adventurers with comparatively tiny cameras tucked into their pockets.\n\nPost-lenticular Landscapes re-enacted these expeditions equipped with the very latest in terrestrial laser scanning technology. This process has unearthed the three dimensional facts of the landscape, allowing the photographic experience of Muybridge, Adams and a thousand other visitors to be digitally replicated and realising Muybridge’s original endeavour to document and share the scenes in three dimensions as stereograms.\n\n#### Expedition - May / June 2016\n\nIn Yosemite ScanLAB established a digital base camp, the centre point of which was a matte grey 4x4 vehicle which acted as our hub for processing collected 3D scan data. Over 15 days we ventured up into the National Park and to a series of key locations including Vernal and Nevada Falls. In the age of the iPhone camera and the selfie our expedition was comparatively heavily laden (our laser scanning equipment took eight people to transport during the expedition!). The logistics of taking such high tech equipment into a comparatively inaccessible environment formed a major part of the re-enactment, mirroring the epic nature of the early pioneer photographers.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"post-lenticular-landscapes-A07.jpg\" />\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"post-lenticular-landscapes-A06.jpg\" />\n#### Urban Diorama - LACMA - Spring 2017 Set within the stripped out interior of\nour expedition vehicle floats a high fidelity hologram of Yosemite Valley.\nMillions of precisely measured points hover together in space to form a ghostly\napparition of mountains, forest, cliff face and tumultuous waterfalls.

Often access was complex but exciting - abseiling 20 meters down through a manhole cover into underground quarries or delicately picking our way in pitch black, water filled tunnels. The result is some of the most comprehensive scanning achieved in Rome, in an unprecedented level of colour, accuracy and detail.\n\n3D Scanning forms the backbone to the show, capturing each location in millimetre detail for immediate, on screen investigation by the presenters. While the scanning is an on screen event in itself, the processed scan data then forms the basis for the show’s graphics, compiling a complex map of subterranean discoveries set within their ancient, and contemporary, aboveground context. Navigating the pointcloud we zoom into views of the entire Roman Forum to see the detailed construction of the Cloaca Maxima below.

The show explores Roman infrastructure and ingenuity, all below ground level. We journeyed via the icy, crystal clear waters of subterranean aqueducts that feed the Trevi fountain and two thousand year old sewers which still function beneath the Roman Forum today, to decadent, labyrinthine catacombs. Our laser scans map these hidden treasures, revealing for the first time the complex network of tunnels, chambers and passageways without which Rome could not have survived as a city of a million people.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"BBCitaly.jpg\" />\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"BBCitaly.jpg\" />\n\nThe team experienced unprecedented access to some of Rome's most recently discovered treasures and most recent archaeological finds, guided by a Rome’s Underground Archaeology Unit. Often access was complex but exciting - abseiling 20 meters down through a manhole cover into underground quarries or delicately picking our way in pitch black, water filled tunnels. The result is some of the most comprehensive scanning achieved in Rome, in an unprecedented level of colour, accuracy and detail.\n\n3D Scanning forms the backbone to the show, capturing each location in millimetre detail for immediate, on screen investigation by the presenters. While the scanning is an on screen event in itself, the processed scan data then forms the basis for the show’s graphics, compiling a complex map of subterranean discoveries set within their ancient, and contemporary, aboveground context. Navigating the pointcloud we zoom into views of the entire Roman Forum to see the detailed construction of the Cloaca Maxima below. The scans highlight ancient pick-marks on the surface of quarry walls, the incredible coloured frescoes of Pagan burial chambers and the delicate carved frieze’s within hidden Mithraic Temples.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"ItalysInvisibleCities_Naples_Herculaneum_01.jpg\" />\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"ItalysInvisibleCities_Naples_NewQuarry_01.jpg\"
