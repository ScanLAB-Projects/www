Further discoveries show whole sections of\njungle circumscribed by a meticulous self-sustaining defensive fortress, highlighting\nthe brutality and bloodthirsty reputation of the Maya.\n\nThe LIDAR datasets transform our understanding of the extent of the Mayan world. Areas thought to be populated by 1 to 2 million people are now estimated to have been home to a population of over 20 million.\n\nThe LIDAR survey and its revelations will allow archaeologists to investigate and uncover Mayan mysteries for generations to come.\n\n\u003CInlineImages>\n  \u003CImageMagic\n    href=\"maya-03-left.jpg\"\n    caption=\"Witzna Pyramid hidden in the jungle\n\"\n  />\n  \u003CImageMagic\n    href=\"maya-04-right.jpg\"\n    caption=\"3D data reconstruction of Witzna Pyramid after the LIDAR survey\n\"\n  />\n\u003C/InlineImages>\n\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"maya-06-map.jpg\"\n  caption=\"Aerial map reconstruction of Guatemala and surrounding countries\n\"\n/>\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"maya-07-pyramids.jpg\"\n  caption=\"Ground LIDAR scan of Tikal\n\"\n/>\n\u003CImageMagic\n  href=\"maya-09.jpg\"\n  caption=\"3D data reconstruction of El Diablo\n\"\n/>","src/content/projects/lost-treasures-of-maya.mdx","26b107325c09c05a","lost-treasures-of-maya.mdx","mail-rail-viewers",{"id":282,"data":284,"filePath":289,"digest":290,"legacyId":291,"deferredRender":25},{"title":285,"client":286,"subtitle":16,"description":287,"tags":288,"background":58},"The Mail Rail Viewers","The Postal Museum","The British Postal Museum opened on the site in July 2017 with two permanent installations Time Telescope & Network Explorer created from those captured 3D scans",[266,34],"src/content/projects/mail-rail-viewers.mdx","535e103bfb25d357","mail-rail-viewers.mdx","mary-rose",{"id":292,"data":294,"filePath":299,"digest":300,"legacyId":301,"deferredRender":25},{"title":295,"client":296,"subtitle":16,"description":16,"tags":297,"vimeo":298},"SKELETONS OF THE MARY ROSE | The New Evidence","Channel Four",[266,79],"325008353","src/content/projects/mary-rose.mdx","9b5c84c05541051c","mary-rose.mdx","man-of-the-woods",{"id":302,"data":304,"filePath":310,"digest":311,"legacyId":312,"deferredRender":25},{"title":305,"client":306,"subtitle":16,"description":307,"tags":308,"vimeo":309},"Man of the Woods","Justin Timberlake World Tour","ScanLAB Projects in collaboration with Good Company created the opening visuals to Justin Timberlake’s 2018-19 Man of the Woods World Tour.",[79,80],"293574104","src/content/projects/man-of-the-woods.mdx","e3eaf3873178dfd0","man-of-the-woods.mdx","museum-made-digital",{"id":313,"data":315,"filePath":322,"digest":323,"legacyId":324,"deferredRender":25},{"title":316,"client":317,"subtitle":16,"description":318,"tags":319,"vimeo":321},"A Museum Made Digital","The Sir John Soane Museum","ScanLAB Projects and The Soane Museum are embarked on an ambitious project to create a digital replica of the Museum for online visitors to explore.",[320,266],"web","199647752","src/content/projects/museum-made-digital.mdx","942a4f1de4d9a63e","museum-made-digital.mdx","noise",{"id":325,"data":327,"filePath":333,"digest":334,"legacyId":335,"deferredRender":25},{"title":328,"client":329,"subtitle":16,"description":330,"tags":331,"vimeo":332},"NOISE: Error in the Void","Surface Gallery","OISE: ERROR IN THE VOID explores the inherent mistakes made by modern technologies of vision.",[33,79],"89021229","src/content/projects/noise.mdx","64e923e530fefe3b","noise.mdx","phantom",{"id":336,"data":338,"filePath":344,"digest":345,"legacyId":346,"deferredRender":25},{"title":339,"client":340,"subtitle":16,"description":341,"tags":342,"vimeo":343},"Phantom | Oculus Rift","New Museum, NYC","Working with artist Daniel Steegmann ScanLAB Project’s have installed a new immersive experience at the New Museum, New York.
