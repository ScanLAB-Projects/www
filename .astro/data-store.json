Buried in the Rock, a VR experience, transports you into the Foggs' world as they rappel into the depths of Northern Ireland's stunning Tullyard cave system.\n\nSet in Northern Ireland, Buried in the Rock is a portrait of two passionate individuals and their motivation to discover new cave passages despite the dangers, darkness and the unknown that may lay ahead. While following Tim and Pam’s descent into the cave, the entire dramatic Tullyard cave system is revealed in stunning miniature detail capturing the otherworldly formations and watery sounds within the cave.\n\nBuried in the Rock premieres internationally at IDFA, then tours independent cinemas and arts venues across the UK, as part of the StoryFutures Xperience programme, starting at BelfastXR Festival.

Despite dangers and close calls, their infectious enthusiasm for bringing scientists and film crews safely to the world's least accessible places shines through.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"BitR_Body1.jpg\" />\n\nTim and Pam Fogg have travelled the world helping TV crews and scientists access some of the world’s least inaccessible places, from tree canopies to live volcanoes. Starting as youth workers they then began to teach people how to access caves safely and eventually started working with the BBC’s Natural History unit in Bristol to enable access for camera crews to film incredible locations. Many of us will never make it to some of these remote locations but VR can get us closer to what it's like for these explorers.\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"BitR_Body2.jpg\" />\nWe meticulously documented Tullyard's details and ambience using LiDAR scanning and\nbinaural audio recordings. The result is an environmental portrait of two ordinary\npeople living extraordinary lives of exploration.\n\nThough few may physically experience such remote splendours, VR transports you closer to the wonder and allure that drives the Foggs ever deeper through tight passages into the unknown. Revealing both the beauty of the cave as well as what drives Tim and Pam to record these uncharted spaces.

In the installation,\nbelow the 3d-printed objects, is some of the oldest photosynthesizing life on earth:\n3.5 billion years old Stromatolites (Greek for “layered rock”). Consisting of layers\nof single-celled cyanobacteria, forming microbial reefs, the stromatolite was a probability\nengine: an actualizer of life.\n\nBefore the stromatolites, air contained only one percent oxygen. Within the stromatolite there is a string of data: the first form of memory, the single-cell bacteria. This lifeform enables more advanced cells to form. A collaborative symbiotic community of cells, packed together and exposed to friction, were the first step towards consciousness.\n\nThis part of the installation is an encounter with a digital entity modelled after the Stromatolites. Tuning in with the visitors movement, without a word, this cluster of points asks the question: what is the actualizer of life in the digital realm?\n\n#### The Memor /\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"eternal-return-04.jpg\" />\nThe central part of Eternal Return is The Memor: a digital archive of buildings,\nlandscapes, sounds, smells and even traces of people.\n\nThe state of a memory in The Memor is much like the human mind: a stable structure of a neural network as it is NOW, but every return to that memory changes it. Mirrored in The Memor are the ways in which traces of the earth’s past are recorded in rocks and fossils, as arrangements of minerals in stable structures that we examine in the present.\n\nWithout a witness to record each event, stars collide, neutrons merge, nebulae form. Likewise without a visitor, The Memor remains an archive of forms, sounds and scents in no particular order.\n\n#### The Fugue /\n\n\u003CImageMagic href=\"eternal-return-06.jpg\" />\nInside The Fugue, pianist Cassie Yukawa-McBurney performs J. S. Bach’s Fugue in A\nMinor BWV 543 written for the organ, arranged by Liszt for piano.\n\nFugue or Fugue State is the psychological term for when the brain does not find where memory is. For the pianist, the fugue played is like a process of remembering. For her audience, the electromagnetic waves of sound carry information to our senses. Remember - only the disturbance is travelling, not the air. The unbodied human consciousness became the disturbance travelling from the old world to the new.\n\nEternal Return is accompanied by a science fiction novel, The Memor by Malin Zimm, which offers an expanded narrative of the exhibition.\n\nE-book download link: [Eternal Return The Memor](href=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/154-ls-eternalreturn/PROMO/Eternal_Return_The_Memor_TheBook.pdf\")\n\nEternal Return is a STRP co-production and collaboration with the artist duo Lundahl & Seitl\n\nEternal Return has been supported by:\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"invert\">\n  \u003CImageMagic href=\"eternal-return-sponsorship-logos.jpg\" />\n\u003C/div>","src/content/projects/eternal-return.mdx","3683e35bb3b1ab47","eternal-return.mdx","felixs-room",{"id":171,"data":173,"body":181,"filePath":182,"digest":183,"legacyId":184,"deferredRender":25},{"title":174,"client":175,"description":176,"banner":177,"tags":178,"background":180},"FELIX'S ROOM","Berliner Ensemble, June 2023","Felix's Room is a digital hybrid theatre production which reconstructs the life of Felix and Erna Ganz after their imprisonment in a so-called 'Judenhaus' in 1942.","FelixsRoom--banner.jpg",[34,179,33],"live","FelixsRoom_Body1--hero.jpg","import Quote from \"$lib/components/Quote.astro\";\nimport Block from \"$lib/components/Block.astro\";\nimport ImageMagic from \"$lib/components/ImageMagic.astro\";\n\nFelix's Room is a digital hybrid theatre production which reconstructs the\nlife of Felix and Erna Ganz after their imprisonment in a so-called\n'Judenhaus' in 1942.

We are a part of this rhythm, we contribute to the cacophony, we are in sync, and we catastrophically collide with the beating pulse of our planet.\n\n**FRAMERATE:** Rhythms Around Us world premieres as part of Tribeca Immersive created especially for the cutting-edge, brand new media systems at Mercer Labs, New York.
