Pistol is a 6-part mini-series written by Craig Pearce and directed by Danny Boyle. It is based on the memoir of legendary Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones, who helped usher in a punk revolution in Britain.

For the final scene of the series series we were asked by Danny Boyle to explore how our scanning technology could add an impossible crescendo to the Sex Pistolsâ€™ infamous last UK gig.

By December 1977, the band had been banned from playing almost everywhere in the UK. Their final UK performance was for the children of striking firefighters at Ivanhoe's in Huddersfield on Christmas Day, 1977.

With Ivanhoe's no longer in existence, the challenge was to amalgamate sets used for filming in multiple locations into one cohesive and believable scene with the addition of a 200-strong volumetrically captured crowd.

Filming the live gig from drone was tracked and merged with our LiDAR scene and rendered out using our engine. In collaboration with Union VFX, the scene was then graded and inserted into the final edit. With the band and over 200 secondary actors from the film captured the dataset and renders reached over 30TB of data.
