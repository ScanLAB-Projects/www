Justin Timberlake's Man of the Woods tour sees the performers and audience transported through a series of epic pointcloud forest landscapes.

Inspired by the album’s backcountry roots, ScanLAB Projects traveled deep into the wilderness of Portland, Oregon to document woodlands and ancient forest, to create digital effigies of the natural world. The studio transformed these digital forests into 14K visual films designed to wrap the stage, weaving in and out of the audience on gigantic semi transparent screens. At times these fragments of forest are idyllic and natural. At other stages they descend into an all absorbing forest rave.
