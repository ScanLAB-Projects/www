Justin Timberlake's Man of the Woods tour see's the performers and audience transported through a series of epic point cloud forest landscapes.

Working with the amazing Alex Moors (Good Company) we created immersive visuals that wrap the stage, weaving in and out of the audience on gigantic semi transparent screens. At times these fragments of forest are idyllic and natural. At other stages they descend into an all absorbing forest rave.

Inspired by the albums backcountry roots, ScanLAB Projects traveled deep into the wilderness of Portland, Oregon to capture woodlands and ancient forest, to create digital effigies of the natural world. The project was a fast paced creative journey - from on location scanning in the Silver Falls State Park to rendered visuals projected at a resolution over 14k for the opening show less than 6 weeks later in Toronto!
