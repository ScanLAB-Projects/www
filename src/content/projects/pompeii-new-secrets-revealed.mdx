**Pompeii | New Secrets Revealed.** BBC’s ONE’s 60 Minute special, Pompeii New Secrets Revealed uncovers the final mysteries of Pompeii. Presenter Mary Beard, renowned classicist and TV historian, explores what life was like in one of the world’s most extraordinary and iconic archaeological sites.

Undoubtedly one of the most tragic gems of the Roman world, Pompeii has laid deep beneath the volcanic ashes of the Mount Vesuvius since the eruption of 79 AD. Utilising the latest in CT, laser and photogrammetric 3D scanning techniques we’ve finally been able to peer inside the casts of Pompeii, reveal the position of slaves quarters hidden underground and examine in unprecedented detail the recently restored frescoes.

Mary unpicks the human stories behind the tragic figures: gladiators, slaves, businesswomen
and children whose remains are famously preserved at Pompeii. With help from expert
Estelle Lazer and her team from University of Sydney the CT data and x-rays have
allowed forensic archaeologists to challenge previous assumptions about their lives
and discover the real identities behind the people unable to escape the eruption.

Captured in forensic detail, the scans of Pompeii represent one of the most comprehensive digitisations of Pompeii to date. Covering the whole archaeological site the scans allow it to be explored like never before.

The CT data, terrestrial laser scanning and aerial photogrammetry was captured on location in Pompeii over 10 days in September 2015. ScanLAB Projects completed all data processing and graphics for the 60 minute documentary which is a Lion TV production for BBC ONE. First screen BBC ONE, 9:00pm, Thursday 3rd March 2016.
