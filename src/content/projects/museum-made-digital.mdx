Sir John Soane’s Museum has been the subject and muse for ScanLAB Projects since 2013. Work ranges from critical conservation projects to an ambitious project to create one of the first digital replicas of a Museum for remote visitors to explore in high resolution 3D with natural navigation. More than a digital twin, Explore Soane is an artwork in conversation with the works collected and created by Soane and his commitment to education and architecture-in-practice. This evolving work serves a beautiful function in the studio’s development; an early ground for testing with a robust history for experimentation of new techniques.

We are honored to make work at Soane’s Museum - it is one of a kind. Built by distinguished 19th century architect Sir John Soane, it was a home, library and museum in one - housing his collection of artworks, sculptures, furniture and artefacts. At his death in 1837, Soane left his house and collection to the nation, stipulating that it should be kept open and free for the public's inspiration and education. We hope that the web-based museum honors and extends his intent to inspire and educate - with a whole new level of interaction.
