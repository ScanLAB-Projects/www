ScanLAB Projects and The Soane Museum have embarked on an ambitious project to create a digital replica of the Museum for visitors to explore online. The website and project utilise the latest in 3D technology to scan and digitise a wide selection of Museum rooms and objects – including Soane’s model room and the ancient sarcophagus of King Seti I.

The Soane Museum is one of a kind. Built by distinguished 19th century architect Sir John Soane, it was a home, library and museum in one – housing his collection of artworks, sculptures, furniture and artefacts. At his death in 1837, Soane left his house and collection to the nation, stipulating that it should be kept open and free for the public’s inspiration and education.

For 180 years, the house has remained meticulously preserved through conservation and restoration. Explore Soane continues this ambition in a powerful new way.

The teams will be adding more rooms, and several more objects, in the future. To inspire and educate, exactly as Sir John Soane wished – with a whole new level of interaction.
