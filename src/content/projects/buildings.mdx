We’re constantly inspired to create work which explore, celebrate and provoke conversation around architecture and space. Over the past 15 years these portraits of buildings represent our ongoing fascination with the dialogue between human perception and architectural form.

In each image are hidden layers of meaning and memory embedded within these spaces, rendering visible what often remains unseen or overlooked in our daily encounters with the built environment.

Each project becomes a conversation—sometimes intimate, sometimes confrontational—with architecture's capacity to contain stories, reflect cultural values, and shape human behavior. In transforming these structures into digital artifacts, we aim not simply to document, but to reveal the poetic dimensions of space and the complex relationships we forge with our constructed surroundings.
