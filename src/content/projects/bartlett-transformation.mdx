description: "The Bartlett School of Architecture underwent Â£30 million renovation between 2013 and 2017, transforming their former home Wates House into an award winning new building 22 Gordon Street. The school occupied a temporary home on Hampstead Road for the period of renovations. Alongside these renovations the school has also opened a new campus, Here East in Stratford. ScanLAB Projects captured all three buildings before & after their transformation, a unique record of life in the school in unprecedented detail."
