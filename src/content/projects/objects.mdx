These portraits of objects and artifacts represent our ongoing fascination with the dialogue between form, function, and the stories embedded within everyday items. Each scan is a digital time capsule, preserving not just the physical attributes of these objects, but also the cultural, historical, and personal significance they carry. From cherished heirlooms to mundane tools, every item tells a unique story of human ingenuity, artistic expression, and the evolution of design across generations.

As we continue to expand this digital archive, we not only preserve the past but also provide invaluable resources for future study, inspiration, and innovation in fields ranging from anthropology and archaeology to design and virtual reality

The Vice-Admiral's undress coat was worn by Nelson (1758-1805) at the Battle of Trafalgar. There is a bullet hole on the left shoulder, blood stains on the tails, and a blood stain on the left sleeve, which is probably that of Nelson's secretary, John Scott, killed earlier in the action.

On the jacket’s left side are Nelson's four orders of chivalry - Knight of the Bath, Order of the Crescent, Order of Ferdinand & Merit and Order of St Joachim - sewn to the front of the coat and over the edge of the lapel so that it could not be unbuttoned.

Designed and manufactured by Robert Stephenson (1803-1859) and Company at Newcastle’s Forth Street Works in 1829 the Rocket has been the fastest locomotive ever built up to that point. Its basic ground-breaking design was crucial for the 25-year-old Stephenson to win the locomotive trials held in Rainhill in 1829 to decide on the future motive power for the Liverpool & Manchester Railway.

Marc Quinn's colossal sculpture, 'Self-conscious Gene,' stands as a striking gateway to the museum's Medicine Galleries. At an imposing 3.5 meters (11'6") tall, this work portrays Rick Genest, better known as 'Zombie Boy,' a figure who gained fame for his unique body art.

Following a period of illness, Genest embarked on an extraordinary journey of self-expression, methodically tattooing his skin with intricate depictions of his internal anatomy. This act of turning himself into a living, breathing anatomical illustration bridges the gap between contemporary body modification culture and centuries-old medical artistry.

Stephen Hawking's wheelchair stands as a powerful symbol of human resilience and intellectual triumph over physical adversity. This customized motorized chair, with its advanced computer system and speech synthesizer, served as both a life-support device and a portal through which one of the greatest minds of our time communicated with the world.

In a remarkable archaeological discovery, a treasure trove of wooden sarcophagi was unearthed in Saqqara, Egypt, offering a fascinating glimpse into the New Kingdom period (16th to 11th century BC). These ancient coffins were found nestled within 52 burial shafts, hidden 10 to 12 meters (40 feet) beneath the desert sands. As the sarcophagi emerged from their millennia-old resting places, they were immediately subjected to state-of-the-art 3D scanning techniques. This on-site digital preservation process marks a significant advancement in archaeological practices, bridging the gap between ancient artifacts and modern documentation methods.

The Handley Page Bi-plane, a masterpiece of early aviation engineering, was meticulously documented through high-fidelity 3D scanning at the National Collections Centre in Wroughton, UK, before taking its place as the centerpiece of the Science Museum's Mathematics Gallery. This archive-quality digital capture serves both as a permanent record of the aircraft's condition and as the foundation for multiple interactive media installations and VR experiences that engage and educate visitors

Before becoming the centerpiece of an innovative botanical exhibition, this stunning sunflower and African Daisies (Osteospermum x hybrida) underwent 3D scanning that revealed the intricate mathematical beauty hidden within its natural form.
