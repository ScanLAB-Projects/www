The Living Death Camps Project by Forensic Architecture combines terrestrial laser scanning with ground penetrating radar to dissect the layers of life and evidence at two concentration camp sites in former Yugoslavia. ScanLAB Projects collaborated with Forensic Architecture and forensic archaeologist Caroline Sturdy-Colls to explore the relationship between the two sites and the problems associated with commemorating their histories. Shaw and Trossell pioneered forensic use of scanning technology partnered with their signature visual methods to explain things that are at the edge of detectability, contributing materially to the shared method of analysis responsible for disassembling the traditional archaeological paradigm of prioritising one period of history over another.

The Living Death Camps project forms part of the European Research Council-funded project hosted by the Centre for Research Architecture, Goldsmiths University of London.
