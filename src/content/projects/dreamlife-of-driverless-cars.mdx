The Dreamlife of Driverless Cars is the first work in a series imagining how the autonomous robots in our life perceive - and misperceive - the world. The film weaves a 3D laser scanner through the streets of London, representing the machine vision of a vehicle in space and time inside each frame of the film.

As the scanner moves through the city, slowing for speed bumps and stopping in traffic, the newly built city map warps and extends depending on the speed at which we move. Stuck in traffic a routemaster bus becomes an elongated, narrow corridor, broken only by the shadow of a passing cyclist. Turning the corner into parliament square duplicates Big Ben as we observe the tower for a second time. If this is what a vehicle sees - what does it do with that vision?
