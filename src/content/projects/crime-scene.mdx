It's 2am, there has been a murder and you are the trainee forensic officer on duty. Can you gather the right evidence to solve the killing? Built for Guardian VR, this interactive experience brings to life the fascinating world of forensic science, allowing you to experience and understand the crucial role it plays during an investigation.

Constructed from interviews with professionals from across the industry, Crime Scene
is forensic science first hand. Dropped into a grisly scene, you’ll need to make
critical decisions fast. It’s imperative to focus the resources of the lab on evidence
most likely to bring about a conviction. Remember, the killer is still on the run
so getting it right first time without error is crucial.

The crime scene is a real set, digitised using 3D scanning technology over the course of two days. Makeup Artists, Prop makers and designers were employed to build a realistic scene reflecting some of the challenges posed by investigators in deciphering the events leading up to the victim's demise.

From homicides to road traffic collisions 3D scanning technology is increasingly
used to capture digital replicas of crime scenes and major incidents. Its
extraordinary level of detail captures both the space and its contents in
millimeter accuracy. The data has an abundance of uses across the investigation
from Criminal Investigations Departments (CID), to the eventual Jurors, placing
audiences back in the scene of the crime to experience or perhaps notice
something impossible at the time.

The experience is built for Google's Pixel and Daydream headset and will also be available for the HTC Vive headset shortly.
