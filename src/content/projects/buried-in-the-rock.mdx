Buried in the Rock is a novel form of VR documentary: a portrait of a place and the people that know it best.

Descend into the dark allure of spelunking with cavers Tim and Pam Fogg, who view each cave as a treasure trove of geological and climate history. The experience transports audiences into the Foggs' world as they rappel into the depths of Northern Ireland's stunning Tullyard cave system - the sort of place most of us will never visit.

Set in Northern Ireland, Buried in the Rock is a portrait of two passionate individuals and their motivation to discover new cave passages despite the dangers, darkness and the unknown that may lay ahead. While following Tim and Pam's descent into the cave, the entire dramatic Tullyard cave system is revealed in stunning miniature detail capturing the otherworldly formations and watery sounds within the cave.

Marvel at the cave's otherworldly rock formations and echoes of dripping water as a miniature 3D map unfurls the entire entry passage.

Then don your headlamp and experience Tullyard's bottom in true 1:1 scale, plunged into darkness alongside the Foggs.

Move freely to find Tim and Pam at different locations, as they muse on their passion for preserving these threatened subterranean realms in the Anthropocene age. Despite dangers and close calls, their infectious enthusiasm for bringing scientists and film crews safely to the world's least accessible places shines through.

Tim and Pam Fogg have travelled the world helping TV crews and scientists access some of the world's least inaccessible places, from tree canopies to live volcanoes. Starting as youth workers they then began to teach people how to access caves safely and eventually started working with the BBC's Natural History unit in Bristol to enable access for camera crews to film incredible locations. Many of us will never make it to some of these remote locations but VR can get us closer to what it's like for these explorers.

We meticulously documented Tullyard's details and ambience using LiDAR scanning and
binaural audio recordings. The result is an environmental portrait of two ordinary
people living extraordinary lives of exploration.

Though few may physically experience such remote splendours, VR transports you closer to the wonder and allure that drives the Foggs ever deeper through tight passages into the unknown. Revealing both the beauty of the cave as well as what drives Tim and Pam to record these uncharted spaces. Caving requires partnership, precision and safety and despite many hair raising moments, their passion for caving is infectious.

Join their descent at the frontier of immersive non-fiction
