### Felix's Room is a digital hybrid theatre production which reconstructs the life of Felix and Erna Ganz after their imprisonment in a so-called 'Judenhaus' in 1942. The Room is simultaneously prison and memory palace: by means of projected holographic effects, Felix and Erna fill the room with ghosts of exuberant parties and journeys to far-off lands, but the proximity of Nazi threat always lingers.

    You could say: high-end playfulness. But it can do much more than a normal
    stage set or a video, which in the best moments becomes a phenomenology of
    perception: The music coagulates into a flickering, the oboe blows a
    disparate melody, the colours disappear from the scans, the performance
    becomes a ghostly symbol of memory, shadow, chimera, whatever pops into your
    head when you try to remember. In these moments, 'Felix's Room' is an
    absolute masterpiece, technically astounding

ScanLAB co-created and co-directed Felix’s Room, collaborating with the Komische
Oper Berlin, the Berliner Ensemble, and writer Adam Ganz to devise new digital narrative
forms at the intersection of theatre, music, and technical innovation. The work uses
projected holographic effects and virtual sets created using high-resolution 3D scans
to transport the audience into the life of Felix and Erna Ganz.

A chest of drawers and a sketched
floor plan are all that survives of the single room in a so-called "Jewish
House" in the Kaiserstraße in Mainz. Felix Ganz and his wife Erna were confined
there for a year after they were evicted from his mansion overlooking the Rhine.
His life as an international businessman is over, his home has been stolen, his
children have escaped. Now his engagement with the world is limited to letters,
the sounds of neighbours and his view of the Gestapo Headquarters across the
street.

    The production is a kind of requiem, a musical journey into virtual reality.
