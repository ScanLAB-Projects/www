### 'Echoes from Taiwan' is ScanLAB’s first international chapter of FRAMERATE featuring a series of Taiwanese landscapes. ‘Echoes’ focuses on bustling, industrious activity in Taipei, Kaohsiung and in and amongst the breathtaking and spiritual landscapes across the island. The work is a collaboration with local Taiwanese producer, Stone Soup Productions and was commissioned by TAICCA.

For our studio’s 9 days in Taiwan we opted for a high frequency FRAMERATE scanning
technique - i.e. scanning every few minutes over a short period of time at each location,
such as 12 hours. We selected locations where significant change could be witnessed
across a day, making careful decisions about locations with Stone Soup. Our locations
included Ningxia Night market, Taipei overnight fish market, a busy intersection
in Taipei, TaylorMade Golf factory in Kaohsiung, Shitoushan Quanhua Temple in Miaoli,
Shifen Waterfall in Pingxi and a tea plantation in Yilan County.

Upon reaching Taipei, our team of three spent a day training three local team members
of StoneSoup - who frequently work as photographers or cinematographers - on the
3D LiDAR scanning equipment and time-lapse technique. The StoneSoup team acted as
our local producers, translators, 3D Scanning Technical Artists and fixers whilst
we were in the country. We brought two scanners with us and recorded 1272 scans and
approximately 32 billion points.
