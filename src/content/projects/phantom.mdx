Working with artist Daniel Steegmann, ScanLAB Projects have installed a new immersive experience at the New Museum, New York. Utilising the Oculus Development Kit 2, visitors are invited to transport their senses to the dense Brazilian rainforest.

Connecting the physical with the psychological, the work was produced within the Mata Atlantica Brazil, one of the most fragile ecosystems of the world. Immersed in the middle of this digital forest, the work makes reference to the indigenous cosmologies and their pantheistic beliefs governing body and environment.
