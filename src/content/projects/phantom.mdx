Phantom was a pioneering embodied 6DOF experience for Oculus DK2, connecting the physical and psychological within the fragile ecosystem of Mata Atlantica Rainforest in Brazil whilst referencing the indigenous cosmologies and their pantheistic beliefs governing body and environment.

ScanLAB Projects traveled with Steegmann to Brazil to scan the forest and create a beautiful, precise digital forest, rendered with their original realtime engine that supported motion tracking before system and SDK functionality existed, developing the studio’s belief that holding spatial data in an embodied state amplifies the artistic intent of the work.
