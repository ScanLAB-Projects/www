Post-lenticular Landscapes (LACMA 2017) found a fantastic new home at the Hyundai ARTLAB in 2018. Our holographic vehicle was accompanied by a series of stunning 2000x1000mm prints and a new 4K animation for the ARTLABâ€™s enormous video walls.

### POST-LENTICULAR LANDSCAPES: NEVADA AND VERNAL FALLS, AFTER WATKINS, MUYBRIDGE AND ADAMS

4K Pointcloud Animation

This pointcloud animation journeys down the Merced River taking in the exact POV of many of the most famous historic images that have defined Yosemite and the idea of the America wilderness for nearly 150 years. Seen through the eyes of the terrestrial laser scanner the entire landscape is perpetually on view; a single frame taken from a Muybridge perspective contains every Watkins and Weed that preceded it and every Adams or iPhone selfie to follow it.

#### EQUIRECTANGULAR LANDSCAPES

2000 x 1000mm Digital Lambda C-type prints

Yosemite Valley seen through the eyes of the terrestrial laser scanner. These digital images occupy strategic POVs that hover close to the iconic (and often dangerous) tripod positions of Watkins, Weed, Muybridge and Adams. Our digitally privileged cameras step beyond the cliff edge that restrained the early photographers and modern iphone users alike to reveal the entire Yosemite Valley in a cloud of over a billion precisely measured (but sometime erroneous) points
