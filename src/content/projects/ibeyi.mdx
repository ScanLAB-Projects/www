Commissioned by the French-Cuban duo ibeyi to create the music video for their first single (OYA), ScanLAB Projects cemented a core tenant in their artistic practice: interdisciplinary collaboration. Trossell and Shaw were responsible for concept, creative direction, and production for the music video for OYA, and went on to create the visuals for their acclaimed World Tour in 2015.

Ibeyi's music draws on their heritage and family history, combining ritual chants with synths, samplers and jazz vocals. The twins' roots are reflected in the polyglot nature of the lyrics â€” sung in English, French and Yoruban (a Nigerian language their ancestors spoke before being brought to Cuba by the Spanish). Ibeyi literally means "twins" in Yoruban dialect.

In keeping with the music, the tour visuals are born from a combination of sources. Visuals draw on the entwined individuality of twins themselves in Ghosts and Stranger Lover. Landscape scans from ancient British forests and tangled exotic jungles echo the more atmospheric tracks Oya and Behind the Curtain. Lost In My mind and Singles called Shaw and Trossell to bring the city to the forefront, with dominating, bleaker, lonelier vistas. In the climax of the show (Fly, River) visuals are psychedelic and thug chic.
