Developed for the launch of Citroën’s new World Rally car at the Paris Motor Show in 2016, the short film Savage Beauty brings to life the C3 WRC concept car in the Portuguese Mountains.

Working with director Mark LLoyd, Citroen, Continental Productions and Brunch, ScanLAB Projects created a virtual landscape based on stages from the The Portuguese WRC Rally, 2016. Combining this with telemetry recorded directly from the car, the animation merges the real with the digital.
