### FRAMERATE: Pulse of the Earth’s hypnotic imagery bears witness to landscapes in flux. The impact of human behaviour and the immense force of nature unfolds around you across an array of screens. This is a space where your perspective may shift.

FRAMERATE: Pulse of the Earth is the first in the FRAMERATE series. The work reveals alterations caused by human-centred industry and the rhythms of the natural world; destruction, extraction, habitation, construction, harvests, growth, and erosion. Three-dimensional stories unfold across this multichannel installation. Hypnotic imagery surrounds you. Audio shifts through the space. Spring breaks, summer sun shines through the leaves as they turn amber and fall a second later. In a quaint English garden a pumpkin grows. A thousand tonnes of steel are crushed. Sand ebbs and flows while a cliff retreats. 268 cows are milked. 519 pints are drunk.

Created from thousands of daily 3D time-lapse scans of British landscapes, the work observes change on a scale impossible to see with the lens of traditional cameras.

This is not just an artwork. The data collected and presented by FRAMERATE is ground-breaking scientific research, containing empirical, measurable facts published that have since been published in NATURE.

We glimpse a future perpetually documented by the eyes of a billion autonomous vehicles and personal devices, creating high fidelity spatial records of the earth.

FRAMERATE: Pulse of the Earth invites you to observe in another way. To think and feel in another time scale: geological time, seasonal time, tidal time. To contemplate change, and the pace of change. This is a space where your perspective might shift.

With the generous support of Taiwanese partner, TAICCA, we produced our first international chapter, ‘Echoes from Taiwan’. The work premiered at TCCF in Taipei where it was exhibited at the Songshan Cultural & Creative Park in November 2023. [More info on that work](/projects/echoes-from-taiwan).

As architects and spatial thinkers where we situate the work has a profound impact on the installations we create. We’re excited to explore new exhibition formats for FRAMERATE as we bring the installation to other galleries and cultural institutions worldwide.
