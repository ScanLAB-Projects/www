BBC ONE’s and PBS’s three episode special - Ancient Invisible Cities follows ScanLAB Projects and presenters Dr Michael Scott and Darius Arya as they explore the invisible secrets and hidden treasures of Cairo, Istanbul, Athens.

The shows explore how these cities, built on the shoulders of many ancient civilizations, have evolved over the course of thousands of years, revealing their engineering marvels, structural gymnastics and hidden architectural gems all buried deep beneath the streets of these modern metropolises.

The team experienced unprecedented access to some of the world’s most known treasures and most recent archaeological finds, guided by on-lieu experts and archeologists. Often access was complex but exciting - abseiling 20 meters down through a manhole cover into underground aqueduct in Athens or delicately picking our way in pitch black, solid rock tunnels in the Pyramids. The result is some of the most comprehensive scanning achieved for these structure, in an unprecedented level of colour, accuracy and detail.

<Heading>CAIRO</Heading>

In Cairo we explore the pyramids, structures which have dominated the Nile landscape for thousands of years. We discover how the engineering and design skills of the ancient Egyptians developed and how in as little as 80 years they master the art of constructing one of the wonders of the ancient world. We look at how modern Cairo is founded and how Saladin’s defensive forts dug deep into the bedrock in search of a source of fresh water to last out Christian Crusader sieges. And we attempt to unravel the riddle of the Sphinx by scanning and comparing depictions of both Khufu and Khafre from the Egyptian Museum to look for a family resemblance.
