### FRAMERATE: Rhythms Around Us bears witness to the flux of life on earth. Surrounded by shifting pointcloud landscapes, submerged in sound, we scale our perspective. Together we see the beautiful, creative, and destructive forces of nature and humanity. We are a part of this rhythm, we contribute to the cacophony, we are in sync, and we catastrophically collide with the beating pulse of our planet.

The World Premier of FRAMERATE: Rhythms Around Us took place at Tribeca Immersive in summer 2024. The second artwork in the FRAMERATE series, it was created especially for the cutting-edge, brand new media systems at Mercer Labs, New York, and filled the Map Room for 6 weeks as part of the Far From Nature program.

Created from thousands of daily 3D time-lapse scans of landscapes and cityscapes,
Rhythms Around Us observes change on a scale impossible to see with the lens of traditional
cameras or with the naked eye.

This is not just an artwork. The data collected and presented by FRAMERATE is ground-breaking scientific research, containing empirical, measurable, occasionally whimsical facts.

268 cows milked. 519 pints drunk. 1528 mm of rainfall. 174,000 people commute. 2,657 flowers bloom. 1 aquifer breached. The bin is emptied, twice.

We glimpse a future perpetually documented and catalogued by the eyes of a billion autonomous vehicles and personal devices, creating high fidelity spatial records of the earth, measuring everything.

FRAMERATE: Rhythms Around Us invites you to observe in another way. To think and feel in another time scale: geological time, seasonal time, tidal time. To contemplate change, and the pace of change. This is a space where your perspective might shift.

Rhythms Around Us is the second work in the FRAMERATE series. The first artwork [FRAMERATE: Pulse of the Earth](/projects/pulse-of-the-earth) premiered at the La Biennale Venice in 2022. The third major artwork, [FRAMERATE: Desert Pulse](/projects/desert-pulse) is in production now, commissioned by the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona to open throughout the Garden and Galleries in October 2025.
