    <p>
      ScanLAB Projects is an artist-led studio exploring the world through
      machine vision technologies, founded in 2010 by Matt Shaw (b 1983) and
      William Trossell (b 1985).
    </p>

    <p>
      Known for their evocative and ambitious body of precision-crafted physical
      and digital artworks which reveal and reflect on beauty, fragility, and
      resilience, ScanLAB invites and challenges us to explore our collective
      future. Their groundbreaking use of 3D scanning and definitive pointcloud
      aesthetic has taken them around the world making a seminal body of work
      that reflects on society and the natural world: from former concentration
      camps to melting arctic ice, from Stephen Hawking’s office to cacti blooms
      in the Sonoran Desert.
    </p>

    <p>
      This artistic practice resolves in a series of physical and digital works
      which thrive at the creative edge of a tool’s ability. Their aesthetic
      provides new ways to see, understand, and feel beyond the capabilities of
      our eyes or traditional cameras. ScanLAB act as a witness, a process
      recursively embedded in their artworks; defining the moment when
      photography becomes spatial, the works serve as a unique archive of our
      rapidly changing planet. They aim to document and interpret both the data
      and the essence of environments and moments that might otherwise be lost
      to time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The London-based team brings together architects, craftspeople,
      photographers, engineers, documentary filmmakers and software developers.
      They regularly collaborate with choreographers, musicians, writers,
      technologists, climate scientists, and researchers to extend the studio's
      impact beyond the gallery - in scientific papers, performance, climate
      activism, and journalism.
    </p>

    <p>
      ScanLAB’s diverse portfolio includes large scale installation, film,
      sculpture, XR, immersive storytelling and live performance which has been
      exhibited at prestigious cultural institutions including the Royal Academy
      (UK), LACMA (USA), Venice Biennale (IT), Louisiana (DK), Barbican (UK),
      the Photographers’ Gallery (UK), STRP Biennial (NL), Espacio Fundación
      Telefónica (ES), Southbank Centre (UK), the Science Museum (UK), The New
      Museum (USA), CPH:DOX (DK), SXSW (USA), the Berliner Ensemble (DE) and
      Tribeca (USA). It has also been widely published by the BBC, PBS, National
      Geographic, Arte, Nature, The New York Times, a nd The Guardian. Past
      collaborators include Danny Boyle, Greenpeace, Apple, MIT, Forensic
      Architecture and Cambridge University.
    </p>

    <p>
      In an era of generative AI, computer graphics, and synthetic realities,
      ScanLAB embraces their commitment to investigation, precision, equity,
      sustainability and truth.
