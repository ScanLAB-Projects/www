	<p>
	  ScanLAB recognises that we are in a climate emergency: the current path for human-based emissions will heat the planet beyond the ‘safe’ 1.5 degree threshold. Since 2022, we have been taking specific, actionable steps to measure the environmental impact of our work and set new standards for the way we deliver projects.
	</p><p>
	  To achieve these goals, we have developed a set of resources and tools. We are sharing these, along with our policy documents and impact reports.
	</p>

	<h4>Sustainability Policy</h4><p>
	  We’ve committed to continuously learning about our impact. We’ve committed to managing our operations so that we have the smallest negative impact, wherever possible. We want the work we make, and the way we work, to be a positive voice for change. This takes a combination of research, careful monitoring and continuous learning.
	</p><p>
	  At all stages we are trying to make sure this policy is not about ticking boxes or achieving points. If an existing system isn’t suited to the way we work or the impact we have, we will do the work to adapt and think creatively about how we can be more useful and accurate. Alongside researching and developing our own sustainability tools, we will continue to benefit from the advice of consultants and experts in the space.
	</p><p>
	  So far, our focus has been predominantly on our environmental impact. Expanding this focus to our social and global impact is an ongoing goal for the studio.
	</p>
	
	<p>Our headline policies are:</p>
		<ul class="max-w-[768px] mx-auto list-disc list-inside pl-8 space-y-1">
			<li class="pl-4">
				We have joined the SME Climate Commitment, which commits us to halving our emission by 2030 and achieving Net Zero by 2050.
			</li><li class="pl-4">
				We commit to choosing the lowest impact option wherever possible, tracking our impact and placing value on continued decrease in impact over time.
			</li><li class="pl-4">
				We commit to making environmentally, socially, and sustainably conscious editorial, content and collaborator decisions.
			</li><li class="pl-4">
				We commit to offsetting any emissions we cannot reduce.

	  NOTE: Our policy document is under review and we expect to publish an updated version in summer 2025.

	<h4>Impact Reports</h4>
	<p>
	  We regularly publish Impact Reports which summarise our impact and our progress towards our goals. Our reporting period is from March to April each year.
	</p>
	<p>Our Impact Report can be downloaded here:</p>

	<h4>Case Studies</h4>
	<p>
	  We also conduct in-depth Case Studies on particular events, parts of a production, techniques, or decision making processes within a project that feel worthy of deeper interrogation for ourselves and for the wider community.
	</p>
	<p>Here are links to download these case studies:</p>

	<h4>Tracking And Resources</h4>
	<p>
		Monitoring is crucial to understanding our impact, to highlighting areas where significant reductions can be made, and to tracking, validating, and improving on the results of any changes we make. Starting with a basic environmental monitoring template we have developed a custom Environmental Monitoring System (EMS) to track the carbon footprint of our studio and our projects.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We have also created a Sustainability Decision Tracking Tool (SDTT). This records the financial cost and CO2e emissions of our decisions, helping us to more fully understand our impact and informing our planning so that a less impactful alternative can be chosen where possible. The tool tracks the high, medium and low impact option for each decision, records the choice made, and outlines the rationale for that choice.
